My name is Timothy Keller, Though on the internet I have been known as Geekboy1011 since about 2009, when the world of computers finally stole me away from reality. I dabble in a little bit of everything from software design and hacking to designing hardware and well just plain old tinkering with stuff that should not be taken apart!

What do I currently do? I co-administrate an amazing community called [![](/Resources/omnimagaopt.svg)Omnimaga.org](http://omnimaga.org). I design hardware for fun and I play a lot of minecraft over at [rcfreak0's comunity server](rcfreak0.com). When I am not awake I am studying my dreams. [Ld4all](http://ld4all.com/) has taught me a lot of wonderful things about lucid dreaming and the power of them.

All in all this blog is about the random ramblings of my waking and sleeping life. Enjoy the stay!
