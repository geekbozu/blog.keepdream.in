The Silver Link Clone is a atmega32u4 masquarading as a Ti Graph Link usb device or as the community calls it the SilverLink.

Over the past few months a few members of the community have had there silverlinks fail for various reasons that have been unidentifiable to us. So the solution we have come up with is to just remake the device on more modern hardware. With this we hope to tweak it to be faster and more robust then the original

It currently uses an arduino leonardo. But there is no arduino specific code for it. Cause the arduino ide is horrible and it can be faster with out it. It uses the lufa stack to handle usb.
Current source code for this project can be found on My [bitbucket](bitbucket.org/Geekboy1011/silverlinkclone)
